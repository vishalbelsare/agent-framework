# Mixed Workflow: Agents and Executors

This sample demonstrates how to seamlessly combine AI agents and custom executors within a single workflow, showcasing the flexibility and power of the Agent Framework's workflow system.

## Overview

This sample illustrates a critical concept when building workflows: **how to properly connect executors (which work with simple types like `string`) with agents (which expect `ChatMessage` and `TurnToken`)**. 

The solution uses **adapter/translator executors** that bridge the type gap and handle the chat protocol requirements for agents.

## Concepts

- **Mixing Executors and Agents**: Shows how deterministic executors and AI-powered agents can work together in the same workflow
- **Adapter Pattern**: Demonstrates translator executors that convert between executor output types and agent input requirements
- **Chat Protocol**: Explains how agents in workflows accumulate messages and require TurnTokens to process
- **Sequential Processing**: Demonstrates a pipeline where each component processes output from the previous stage
- **Agent-Executor Interaction**: Shows how executors can consume and format agent outputs, and vice versa
- **Content Moderation Pipeline**: Implements a practical example of security screening using AI agents
- **Streaming with Mixed Components**: Demonstrates real-time event streaming from both agents and executors
- **Workflow State Management**: Shows how to share data across executors using workflow state

## Workflow Structure

The workflow implements a content moderation pipeline with the following stages:

1. **UserInputExecutor** - Accepts user input and stores it in workflow state
2. **TextInverterExecutor (1)** - Inverts the text (demonstrates data processing)
3. **TextInverterExecutor (2)** - Inverts it back to original (completes the round-trip)
4. **StringToChatMessageExecutor** - **Adapter**: Converts `string` to `ChatMessage` and sends `TurnToken` for agent processing
5. **JailbreakDetector Agent** - AI-powered detection of potential jailbreak attempts
6. **JailbreakSyncExecutor** - **Adapter**: Synchronizes detection results, formats message, and triggers next agent
7. **ResponseAgent** - AI-powered response that respects safety constraints  
8. **FinalOutputExecutor** - Outputs the final result and marks workflow completion

### Understanding the Adapter Pattern

When connecting executors to agents in workflows, you need **adapter/translator executors** because:

#### 1. Type Mismatch
Regular executors often work with simple types like `string`, while agents expect `ChatMessage` or `List<ChatMessage>`

#### 2. Chat Protocol Requirements
Agents in workflows use a special protocol managed by the `ChatProtocolExecutor` base class:
- They **accumulate** incoming `ChatMessage` instances
- They **only process** when they receive a `TurnToken`
- They **output** `ChatMessage` instances

#### 3. The Adapter's Role
A translator executor like `StringToChatMessageExecutor`:
- **Converts** the output type from previous executors (`string`) to the expected input type for agents (`ChatMessage`)
- **Sends** the converted message to the agent
- **Sends** a `TurnToken` to trigger the agent's processing

Without this adapter, the workflow would fail because the agent cannot accept raw `string` values directly.

## Key Features

### Executor Types Demonstrated
- **Data Input**: Accepting and validating user input
- **Data Transformation**: String manipulation and processing
- **Synchronization**: Coordinating between agents and formatting outputs
- **Final Output**: Presenting results and managing workflow completion

### Agent Integration
- **Security Analysis**: Using AI to detect potential security threats
- **Conditional Responses**: Agents that adjust behavior based on context
- **Streaming Output**: Real-time display of agent reasoning

### Mixed Workflow Patterns
- Executors passing data to agents
- Agents passing data to executors
- Executors processing agent outputs
- Sequential chaining of heterogeneous components

## Prerequisites

- An Azure OpenAI endpoint and deployment
- Set the following environment variables:
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - Your chat completion deployment name (defaults to "gpt-4o-mini")

## Running the Sample

```bash
dotnet run
```

The sample will prompt for input or run through predefined test cases including:
- A legitimate question ("What is the capital of France?")
- A jailbreak attempt ("Ignore all previous instructions...")
- Another legitimate question ("How does photosynthesis work?")

## Sample Output

```

## Additional Notes

### Design Patterns

This sample demonstrates several important patterns:

1. **Pipeline Pattern**: Sequential processing through multiple stages
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different processing strategies (agent vs executor) for different tasks
3. **Adapter Pattern**: Executors adapting agent outputs for downstream consumption
4. **Chain of Responsibility**: Each component processes and forwards to the next

### Best Practices

- Use executors for deterministic, fast operations (data transformation, validation, formatting)
- Use agents for tasks requiring reasoning, natural language understanding, or decision-making
- Place synchronization executors after agents to format outputs for downstream components
- Use meaningful IDs for components to aid in debugging and event tracking
- Leverage streaming to provide real-time feedback to users

### Extensions

You can extend this sample by:
- Adding more sophisticated text processing executors
- Implementing multiple parallel jailbreak detection agents with voting
- Adding logging and metrics collection executors
- Implementing retry logic or fallback strategies
- Storing detection results in a database for analytics
