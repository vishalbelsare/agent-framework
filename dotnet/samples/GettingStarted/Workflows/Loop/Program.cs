/// This sample demonstrates a simple number guessing game using a workflow with looping behavior.

/// The workflow consists of two executors that are connected in a feedback loop:
/// 1. GuessNumberExecutor: Makes a guess based on the current known bounds.
/// 2. JudgeExecutor: Evaluates the guess and provides feedback.
/// The workflow continues until the correct number is guessed.
