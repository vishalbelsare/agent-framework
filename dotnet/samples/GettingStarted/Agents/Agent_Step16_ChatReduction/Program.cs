// This sample shows how to use a chat history reducer to keep the context within model size limits.
// Any implementation of Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatReducer can be used to customize how the chat history is reduced.
// NOTE: this feature is only supported where the chat history is stored locally, such as with OpenAI Chat Completion.
// Where the chat history is stored server side, such as with Azure Foundry Agents, the service must manage the chat history size.
