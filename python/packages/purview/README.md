## Microsoft Agent Framework – Purview Integration (Python)

`agent-framework-purview` adds Microsoft Purview (Microsoft Graph dataSecurityAndGovernance) policy evaluation to the Microsoft Agent Framework. It lets you enforce data security / governance policies on both the *prompt* (user input + conversation history) and the *model response* before they proceed further in your workflow.

> Status: **Preview**

### Key Features

- Middleware-based policy enforcement (agent-level and chat-client level)
- Blocks or allows content at both ingress (prompt) and egress (response)
- Works with any `ChatAgent` / agent orchestration using the standard Agent Framework middleware pipeline
- Supports both synchronous `TokenCredential` and `AsyncTokenCredential` from `azure-identity`
- Simple, typed configuration via `PurviewSettings` / `PurviewAppLocation`
- Two middleware types:
	- `PurviewPolicyMiddleware` (Agent pipeline)
	- `PurviewChatPolicyMiddleware` (Chat client middleware list)

### When to Use
Add Purview when you need to:

- Prevent sensitive or disallowed content from being sent to an LLM
- Prevent model output containing disallowed data from leaving the system
- Apply centrally managed policies without rewriting agent logic

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from agent_framework import ChatAgent, ChatMessage, Role
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIChatClient
from agent_framework.microsoft import PurviewPolicyMiddleware, PurviewSettings
from azure.identity import InteractiveBrowserCredential

async def main():
	chat_client = AzureOpenAIChatClient()  # uses environment for endpoint + deployment

	purview_middleware = PurviewPolicyMiddleware(
		credential=InteractiveBrowserCredential(),
		settings=PurviewSettings(app_name="My Sample App")
	)

	agent = ChatAgent(
		chat_client=chat_client,
		instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
		middleware=[purview_middleware]
	)

	response = await agent.run(ChatMessage(role=Role.USER, text="Summarize zero trust in one sentence."))
	print(response)

asyncio.run(main())
```

If a policy violation is detected on the prompt, the middleware terminates the run and substitutes a system message: `"Prompt blocked by policy"`. If on the response, the result becomes `"Response blocked by policy"`.

---

## Authentication

`PurviewClient` uses the `azure-identity` library for token acquisition. You can use any `TokenCredential` or `AsyncTokenCredential` implementation.

The APIs require the following Graph Permissions:
- ProtectionScopes.Compute.All : [userProtectionScopeContainer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/userprotectionscopecontainer-compute)
- Content.Process.All : [processContent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/userdatasecurityandgovernance-processcontent)
- ContentActivity.Write : [contentActivity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/activitiescontainer-post-contentactivities)

### Scopes
`PurviewSettings.get_scopes()` derives the Graph scope list (currently `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` style).

### Tenant Enablement for Purview
- The tenant requires an e5 license and consumptive billing setup.
- There need to be [Data Loss Prevention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/dlp-create-deploy-policy) or [Data Collection Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/collection-policies-policy-reference) that apply to the user to call Process Content API else it calls Content Activities API for auditing the message.

## Configuration

### `PurviewSettings`

```python
PurviewSettings(
    app_name="My App",                # Display / logical name
    tenant_id=None,                    # Optional – used mainly for auth context
    purview_app_location=None,         # Optional PurviewAppLocation for scoping
    graph_base_uri="https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/",
    process_inline=False,              # Reserved for future inline processing optimizations
    blocked_prompt_message="Prompt blocked by policy",    # Custom message for blocked prompts
    blocked_response_message="Response blocked by policy" # Custom message for blocked responses
)
```

To scope evaluation by location (application, URL, or domain):

```python
from agent_framework.microsoft import (
	PurviewAppLocation,
	PurviewLocationType,
	PurviewSettings,
)

settings = PurviewSettings(
	app_name="Contoso Support",
	purview_app_location=PurviewAppLocation(
		location_type=PurviewLocationType.APPLICATION,
		location_value="<app-client-id>"
	)
)
```

### Customizing Blocked Messages

By default, when Purview blocks a prompt or response, the middleware returns a generic system message. You can customize these messages by providing your own text in the `PurviewSettings`:

```python
from agent_framework.microsoft import PurviewSettings

settings = PurviewSettings(
	app_name="My App",
	blocked_prompt_message="Your request contains content that violates our policies. Please rephrase and try again.",
	blocked_response_message="The response was blocked due to policy restrictions. Please contact support if you need assistance."
)
```

This is useful for:
- Providing more user-friendly error messages
- Including support contact information
- Localizing messages for different languages
- Adding branding or specific guidance for your application

### Selecting Agent vs Chat Middleware

Use the agent middleware when you already have / want the full agent pipeline:

```python
from agent_framework import ChatAgent
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIChatClient
from agent_framework.microsoft import PurviewPolicyMiddleware, PurviewSettings
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = AzureOpenAIChatClient()

agent = ChatAgent(
	chat_client=client,
	instructions="You are helpful.",
	middleware=[PurviewPolicyMiddleware(credential, PurviewSettings(app_name="My App"))]
)
```

Use the chat middleware when you attach directly to a chat client (e.g. minimal agent shell or custom orchestration):

```python
import os
from agent_framework import ChatAgent
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIChatClient
from agent_framework.microsoft import PurviewChatPolicyMiddleware, PurviewSettings
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

chat_client = AzureOpenAIChatClient(
	deployment_name=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],
	endpoint=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"],
	credential=credential,
	middleware=[
		PurviewChatPolicyMiddleware(credential, PurviewSettings(app_name="My App (Chat)"))
	],
)

agent = ChatAgent(chat_client=chat_client, instructions="You are helpful.")
```

The policy logic is identical; the difference is only the hook point in the pipeline.

## Middleware Lifecycle

1. Before agent execution (`prompt phase`): all `context.messages` are evaluated.
2. If blocked: `context.result` is replaced with a system message and `context.terminate = True`.
3. After successful agent execution (`response phase`): the produced messages are evaluated.
4. If blocked: result messages are replaced with a blocking notice.

When a user identifier is discovered (e.g. in `ChatMessage.additional_properties['user_id']`) during the prompt phase it is reused for the response phase so both evaluations map consistently to the same user.

You can customize the blocking messages using the `blocked_prompt_message` and `blocked_response_message` fields in `PurviewSettings`. For more advanced scenarios, you can wrap the middleware or post-process `context.result` in later middleware.

## Exceptions

| Exception | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| `PurviewAuthenticationError` | Token acquisition / validation issues |
| `PurviewRateLimitError` | 429 responses from service |
| `PurviewRequestError` | 4xx client errors (bad input, unauthorized, forbidden) |
| `PurviewServiceError` | 5xx or unexpected service errors |

Catch broadly if you want unified fallback:

```python
from agent_framework.microsoft import (
	PurviewAuthenticationError, PurviewRateLimitError,
	PurviewRequestError, PurviewServiceError
)

try:
	...
except (PurviewAuthenticationError, PurviewRateLimitError, PurviewRequestError, PurviewServiceError) as ex:
	# Log / degrade gracefully
	print(f"Purview enforcement skipped: {ex}")
```

---

## Notes
- Provide a `user_id` per request (e.g. in `ChatMessage(..., additional_properties={"user_id": "<guid>"})`) when possible for per-user policy scoping; otherwise supply a default via settings or environment.
- Blocking messages can be customized via `blocked_prompt_message` and `blocked_response_message` in `PurviewSettings`. By default, they are "Prompt blocked by policy" and "Response blocked by policy" respectively.
- Streaming responses: post-response policy evaluation presently applies only to non-streaming chat responses.
- Errors during policy checks are logged and do not fail the run; they degrade gracefully.
