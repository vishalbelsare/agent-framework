    ## Overview
    Represents the complete execution results of a workflow run, containing all events
    generated from start to idle state. Workflows produce outputs incrementally through
    ctx.yield_output() calls during execution.

    ## Event Structure
    Maintains separation between data-plane and control-plane events:
    - Data-plane events: Executor invocations, completions, outputs, and requests (in main list)
    - Control-plane events: Status timeline accessible via status_timeline() method

    ## Key Methods
    - get_outputs(): Extract all workflow outputs from the execution
    - get_request_info_events(): Retrieve external input requests made during execution
    - get_final_state(): Get the final workflow state (IDLE, IDLE_WITH_PENDING_REQUESTS, etc.)
    - status_timeline(): Access the complete status event history

class Workflow(DictConvertible):
    """A graph-based execution engine that orchestrates connected executors.

    ## Overview
    A workflow executes a directed graph of executors connected via edge groups using a Pregel-like model,
    running in supersteps until the graph becomes idle. Workflows are created using the
    WorkflowBuilder class - do not instantiate this class directly.

    ## Execution Model
    Executors run in synchronized supersteps where each executor:
    - Is invoked when it receives messages from connected edge groups
    - Can send messages to downstream executors via ctx.send_message()
    - Can yield workflow-level outputs via ctx.yield_output()
    - Can emit custom events via ctx.add_event()

    Messages between executors are delivered at the end of each superstep and are not
    visible in the event stream. Only workflow-level events (outputs, custom events)
    and status events are observable to callers.

    ## Input/Output Types
    Workflow types are discovered at runtime by inspecting:
    - Input types: From the start executor's input types
    - Output types: Union of all executors' workflow output types
    Access these via the input_types and output_types properties.

    ## Execution Methods
    - run(): Execute to completion, returns WorkflowRunResult with all events
    - run_stream(): Returns async generator yielding events as they occur
    - run_from_checkpoint(): Resume from a saved checkpoint
    - run_stream_from_checkpoint(): Resume from checkpoint with streaming

    ## External Input Requests
    Executors within a workflow can request external input using `ctx.request_info()`:
    1. Executor calls `ctx.request_info()` to request input
    2. Executor implements `response_handler()` to process the response
    3. Requests are emitted as RequestInfoEvent instances in the event stream
    4. Workflow enters IDLE_WITH_PENDING_REQUESTS state
    5. Caller handles requests and uses send_responses()/send_responses_streaming() to continue
    6. Responses are routed back to the requesting executors and response handlers are invoked

    ## Checkpointing
    When enabled, checkpoints are created at the end of each superstep, capturing:
    - Executor states
    - Messages in transit
    - Shared state
    Workflows can be paused and resumed across process restarts using checkpoint storage.

    ## Composition
    Workflows can be nested using WorkflowExecutor, which wraps a child workflow as an executor.
    The nested workflow's input/output types become part of the WorkflowExecutor's types.
    When invoked, the WorkflowExecutor runs the nested workflow to completion and processes its outputs.
