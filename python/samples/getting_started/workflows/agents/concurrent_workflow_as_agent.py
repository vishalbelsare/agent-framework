"""
Sample: Build a concurrent workflow orchestration and wrap it as an agent.

This script wires up a fan-out/fan-in workflow using `ConcurrentBuilder`, and then
invokes the entire orchestration through the `workflow.as_agent(...)` interface so
downstream coordinators can reuse the orchestration as a single agent.

Demonstrates:
- Fan-out to multiple agents, fan-in aggregation of final ChatMessages.
- Reusing the orchestrated workflow as an agent entry point with `workflow.as_agent(...)`.
- Workflow completion when idle with no pending work

Prerequisites:
- Azure OpenAI access configured for AzureOpenAIChatClient (use az login + env vars)
- Familiarity with Workflow events (AgentRunEvent, WorkflowOutputEvent)

        likely to include students, young professionals, and price-sensitive urban residents.
    - **Market Trends:** E-bike sales are growing globally, with increasing urbanization,
        higher fuel costs, and sustainability concerns driving adoption.
    - **Competitive Landscape:** Key competitors include brands like Rad Power Bikes, Aventon,
        Lectric, and domestic budget-focused manufacturers in North America, Europe, and Asia.
    - **Feature Expectations:** Customers expect reliability, ease-of-use, theft protection,
        lightweight design, sufficient battery range for daily city commutes (typically 25-40 miles),
        and low-maintenance components.

    **Opportunities:**

    - **First-time Buyers:** Capture newcomers to e-biking by emphasizing affordability, ease of
        operation, and cost savings vs. public transit/car ownership.

    04 [legal]:
    **Constraints, Disclaimers, & Policy Concerns for Launching a Budget-Friendly Electric Bike for Urban Commuters:**

    **1. Regulatory Compliance**
    - Verify that the electric bike meets all applicable federal, state, and local regulations
        regarding e-bike classification, speed limits, power output, and safety features.
    - Ensure necessary certifications (e.g., UL certification for batteries, CE markings if sold internationally) are obtained.

    **2. Product Safety**
    - Include consumer safety warnings regarding use, battery handling, charging protocols, and age restrictions.
