Sample: Map reduce word count with fan out and fan in over file backed intermediate results

The workflow splits a large text into chunks, maps words to counts in parallel,
shuffles intermediate pairs to reducers, then reduces to per word totals.
It also demonstrates WorkflowViz for graph visualization.

Purpose:
Show how to:
- Partition input once and coordinate parallel mappers with shared state.
- Implement map, shuffle, and reduce executors that pass file paths instead of large payloads.
- Use fan out and fan in edges to express parallelism and joins.
- Persist intermediate results to disk to bound memory usage for large inputs.
- Visualize the workflow graph using WorkflowViz and export to SVG with the optional viz extra.

Prerequisites:
- Familiarity with WorkflowBuilder, executors, fan out and fan in edges, events, and streaming runs.
- aiofiles installed for async file I/O.
- Write access to a tmp directory next to this script.
- A source text at resources/long_text.txt.
- Optional for SVG export: install graphviz.

Installation:
    pip install agent-framework aiofiles graphviz
