Sample: Human in the loop guessing game

An agent guesses a number, then a human guides it with higher, lower, or
correct. The loop continues until the human confirms correct, at which point
the workflow completes when idle with no pending work.

Purpose:
Show how to integrate a human step in the middle of an LLM workflow by using
`request_info` and `send_responses_streaming`.

Demonstrate:
- Alternating turns between an AgentExecutor and a human, driven by events.
- Using Pydantic response_format to enforce structured JSON output from the agent instead of regex parsing.
- Driving the loop in application code with run_stream and send_responses_streaming.

Prerequisites:
- Azure OpenAI configured for AzureOpenAIChatClient with required environment variables.
- Authentication via azure-identity. Use AzureCliCredential and run az login before executing the sample.
- Basic familiarity with WorkflowBuilder, executors, edges, events, and streaming runs.
"""

# How human-in-the-loop is achieved via `request_info` and `send_responses_streaming`:
# - An executor (TurnManager) calls `ctx.request_info` with a payload (HumanFeedbackRequest).
# - The workflow run pauses and emits a RequestInfoEvent with the payload and the request_id.
# - The application captures the event, prompts the user, and collects replies.
# - The application calls `send_responses_streaming` with a map of request_ids to replies.
# - The workflow resumes, and the response is delivered to the executor method decorated with @response_handler.
# - The executor can then continue the workflow, e.g., by sending a new message to the agent.
