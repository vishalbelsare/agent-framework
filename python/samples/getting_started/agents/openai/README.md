## Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables before running the examples:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL_ID`: The OpenAI model to use (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- `OPENAI_RESPONSES_MODEL_ID`: The OpenAI model to use (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- For image processing examples, use a vision-capable model like `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini`

Optionally, you can set:
- `OPENAI_ORG_ID`: Your OpenAI organization ID (if applicable)
- `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL`: Your OpenAI base URL (if using a different base URL)

## Optional Dependencies

Some examples require additional dependencies:

- **Image Generation Example**: The `openai_responses_client_image_generation.py` example requires PIL (Pillow) for image display. Install with:
  ```bash
  # Using uv
  uv add pillow

  # Or using pip
  pip install pillow
  ```
