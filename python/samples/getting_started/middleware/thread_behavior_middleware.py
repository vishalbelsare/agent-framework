Thread Behavior Middleware Example

This sample demonstrates how middleware can access and track thread state across multiple agent runs.
The example shows:

- How AgentRunContext.thread property behaves across multiple runs
- How middleware can access conversation history through the thread
- The timing of when thread messages are populated (before vs after next() call)
- How to track thread state changes across runs

Key behaviors demonstrated:
1. First run: context.messages is populated, context.thread is initially empty (before next())
2. After next(): thread contains input message + response from agent
3. Second run: context.messages contains only current input, thread contains previous history
4. After next(): thread contains full conversation history (all previous + current messages)
