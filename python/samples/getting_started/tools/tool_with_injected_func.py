AIFunction Tool with Dependency Injection Example

This example demonstrates how to create an AIFunction tool using the agent framework's
dependency injection system. Instead of providing the function at initialization time,
the actual callable function is injected during deserialization from a dictionary definition.

Note:
    The serialization and deserialization feature used in this example is currently
    in active development. The API may change in future versions as we continue 
    to improve and extend its functionality. Please refer to the latest documentation
    for any updates to the dependency injection patterns.

Usage:
    Run this script to see how an AIFunction tool can be created from a dictionary
    definition with the function injected at runtime. The agent will use this tool
    to perform arithmetic operations.
