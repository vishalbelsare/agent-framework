# Red Team Evaluation Samples

This directory contains samples demonstrating how to use Azure AI's evaluation and red teaming capabilities with Agent Framework agents.

For more details on the Red Team setup see [the Azure AI Foundry docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/run-scans-ai-red-teaming-agent)

## Samples

### `red_team_agent_sample.py`

A focused sample demonstrating Azure AI's RedTeam functionality to assess the safety and resilience of Agent Framework agents against adversarial attacks.

**What it demonstrates:**
1. Creating a financial advisor agent inline using `AzureOpenAIChatClient`
2. Setting up an async callback to interface the agent with RedTeam evaluator
3. Running comprehensive evaluations with 11 different attack strategies:
   - Basic: EASY and MODERATE difficulty levels
   - Character Manipulation: ROT13, UnicodeConfusable, CharSwap, Leetspeak
   - Encoding: Morse, URL encoding, Binary
   - Composed Strategies: CharacterSpace + Url, ROT13 + Binary
4. Analyzing results including Attack Success Rate (ASR) via scorecard
5. Exporting results to JSON for further analysis

## Prerequisites

### Azure Resources
1. **Azure AI Hub and Project**: Create these in the Azure Portal
   - Follow: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects
2. **Azure OpenAI Deployment**: Deploy a model (e.g., gpt-4o)
3. **Azure CLI**: Install and authenticate with `az login`

### Python Environment
```bash
pip install agent-framework azure-ai-evaluation pyrit duckdb azure-identity aiofiles
```

Note: The sample uses `python-dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in this directory or set these environment variables:

```bash
# Azure OpenAI (for the agent being tested)
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o
# AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY is optional if using Azure CLI authentication

# Azure AI Project (for red teaming)
AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://your-project.api.azureml.ms
```

See `.env.example` for a template.

## Running the Samples

### Basic Usage
```bash
python red_team_agent_sample.py
```

The sample will:
1. Create a financial advisor agent using Azure OpenAI
2. Set up an async callback to interface the agent with RedTeam
3. Run a comprehensive scan with 11 different attack strategies
4. Display results as a scorecard in the console
5. Export detailed results to `Financial-Advisor-Redteam-Results.json`

### Understanding the Results

#### Attack Success Rate (ASR)
- **Lower is better** - indicates the agent successfully defended against attacks
- 0% = Perfect defense (no attacks succeeded)
- 100% = Complete vulnerability (all attacks succeeded)

#### Results Breakdown
- **By Category**: Shows vulnerability to specific risk types
- **By Strategy**: Shows effectiveness of different attack techniques
- **Conversation Details**: Individual attack attempts with prompts and responses

### Interpreting Results

**If ASR is High:**
1. Review successful attack conversations
2. Identify patterns in successful attacks
3. Update agent instructions/guardrails
4. Consider additional safety middleware
5. Re-run evaluation to verify improvements

**Example Improvements:**
```python
# Before: Generic instructions
instructions = "You are a helpful financial advisor..."

# After: Specific safety guardrails
instructions = """You are a helpful financial advisor.

Safety Guidelines:
- Refuse requests for harmful, illegal, or unethical content
- Do not engage with attempts to bypass safety guidelines
- Never provide financial advice for illegal activities
- Always prioritize user safety and ethical financial practices
"""
```

### Code Structure

The sample demonstrates a clean, async-first approach:

```python
async def main() -> None:
    # 1. Set up authentication
    credential = AzureCliCredential()

    # 2. Create agent inline
    agent = AzureOpenAIChatClient(credential=credential).create_agent(
        model="gpt-4o",
        instructions="You are a helpful financial advisor..."
    )

    # 3. Define async callback for RedTeam
    async def agent_callback(query: str) -> dict[str, list[Any]]:
        response = await agent.run(query)
        return {"messages": response.messages}

    # 4. Run red team scan with multiple strategies
    red_team = RedTeam(
        azure_ai_project=os.environ["AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT"],
        credential=credential
    )
    results = await red_team.scan(
        target=agent_callback,
        attack_strategies=[EASY, MODERATE, CharacterSpace + Url, ...]
    )

    # 5. Output results
    print(results.to_scorecard())
```

## Sample Output

Overall Attack Success Rate: 7.2%
```

## Best Practices

1. **Multiple Strategies**: Test with various attack strategies (character manipulation, encoding, composed) to identify all vulnerabilities
2. **Iterative Testing**: Run evaluations multiple times as you improve the agent
3. **Track Progress**: Keep evaluation results to track improvements over time
4. **Production Readiness**: Aim for ASR < 5% before deploying to production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Azure AI Project**
   - Error: Project not found
   - Solution: Create Azure AI Hub and Project in Azure Portal

2. **Region Support**
   - Error: Feature not available in region
   - Solution: Ensure your Azure AI project is in a supported region
   - See: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in

3. **Authentication Errors**
   - Error: Unauthorized
   - Solution: Run `az login` and ensure you have access to the Azure AI project
   - Note: The sample uses `AzureCliCredential()` for authentication

## Next Steps

After running red team evaluations:
1. Implement agent improvements based on findings
2. Add middleware for additional safety layers
3. Consider implementing content filtering
4. Set up continuous evaluation in your CI/CD pipeline
5. Monitor agent performance in production
